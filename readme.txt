This is my personal arch linux setup script which I use to initialize some things I like on a fresh installation.

It assumes GNOME is installed.

Usage:

Download and unzip in home directory (~), then:

./install.sh

Don't run it as root. It won't break anything catastrophically (as far as I can tell) but it will install things to the /root folder instead of home folder, which will prevent it from working properly.
